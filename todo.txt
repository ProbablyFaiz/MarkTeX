    o templatelang
        o maybe naming things with lowercase instead of prefix t, so while instead of tWhile and set instead of tSet
            o the only problem is with built-in keyword if, but this could be ifVal or (?) or something (or just stay tIf)
            o then you have get, set, insert, while etc.

    o testing
        o make a test suite

    o json data
        o should expect data in relative ./data folder
        o support for multiple jsons?
            o metacommand for reading additional data
            ~ nest the data in the environment such that you have to do file1.name, file2.name or possibly overwrite stuff?
            ~ support sub-folders with json files?
            -> supports additional loading of data by user!

    ~ images
        ~ should expect data in relative ./images folder

    o latex conversion
        o docSettings -> include latex imports?
        ~ alter image positioning? (right now it is sometimes positioned at the top of the pdf file)

    o pdf conversion
        o do pdf conversion in a temporary folder
            o cleanup all temporary files and temporary folder
        o hide pdflatex output if possible?
        o possibly run the conversion twice for nicer output? (saw that in the pdflatex output)

    o handle errors more explicitly
        o print more specific error messages which indicate what went wrong and what the issue is/might be + possible solution?

    ~ project-level things
        ~ clean up temporary files/chunks of code
        - fill out readme.md's/package.yaml's
        ~ rename stuff where needed
        ~ specific importing/exporting of functions/datatypes
        - commenting everything + haddock documentation

    o cleanup rootexpr
        o the meta-evaluation of a while now for example generates a separate list for every iteration of the loop, while you probably want one list containing an item for each iteration
        o find out why there are so many newlines in the generated latex? (not really a problem i think)

    o doc-settings (we don't use this yet really)
        o page margin, page numbering, page footer/header, table of contents probably?

    o latex input/commands
        o literal text is copied over, so this is supported in some sense (like the example with $$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $$ )
        o otherwise shortcuts for color and similar things like we discussed, but how to tackle this exactly?

    - user options
        - choose whether to convert to md/latex/pdf may be nice (as an input argument to the program or a doc-setting?)
        ~ output to md/html maybe?
        ~ output to latex without pdf conversion if you want to do intermediate latex changes?
    - tables if there are really no more things to do, probably better to avoid this now, since we would have to make changes everywhere

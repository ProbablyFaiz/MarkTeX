    - templatelang
        - maybe naming things with lowercase instead of prefix t, so while instead of tWhile and set instead of tSet
            - the only problem is with built-in keyword if, but this could be ifVal or (?) or something (or just stay tIf)
            - then you have get, set, insert, while etc.

    - testing
        - make a test suite

    - json data
        - should expect data in relative ./data folder
        - support for multiple jsons?
            - nest the data in the environment such that you have to do file1.name, file2.name or possibly overwrite stuff?
            - support sub-folders with json files?

    - images
        - should expect data in relative ./image folder

    - latex conversion
        - docSettings -> include latex imports?
        - alter image positioning? (right now it is sometimes positioned at the top of the pdf file)

    - pdf conversion
        - do pdf conversion in a temporary folder
            - cleanup all temporary files and temporary folder
        - hide pdflatex output if possible?
        - possibly run the conversion twice for nicer output? (saw that in the pdflatex output)

    - handle errors more explicitly
        - print more specific error messages which indicate what went wrong and what the issue is/might be + possible solution?

    - project-level things
        - clean up temporary files/chunks of code
        - fill out readme.md's/package.yaml's
        - rename stuff where needed
        - specific importing/exporting of functions/datatypes
        - commenting everything

    - clean rootexpr
        - the meta-evaluation of a while now for example generates a separate list for every iteration of the loop, while you probably want one list containing an item for each iteration
        - find out why there are so many newlines in the generated latex? (not really a problem i think)

    - user options
        - choose whether to convert to md/latex/pdf may be nice (as an input argument to the program or a doc-setting?)

    - doc-settings (we don't use this yet really)
        - page margin, page numbering, page footer/header, table of contents probably?

    - latex input/commands
        - literal text is copied over, so this is supported in some sense (like the example with $$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $$ )
        - otherwise shortcuts for color and similar things like we discussed, but how to tackle this exactly?

    - tables if there are really no more things to do, probably better to avoid this now, since we would have to make changes everywhere
